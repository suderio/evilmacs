# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We do not have supported versions for security vulnerabilities. They will be available after version 1.0.

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.0   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to paulo.suderio@technearts.net. 
You will receive a response from us as soon as possible. 
If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity but historically within a few days.
